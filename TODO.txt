TODO
====
- Change classifier index in Runtime constructor to be a string with the 
    property name. Indexes are not nice.
- Profile!!!!!!! and IL replace dodgy java code.  Would be awesome to use 
  Intel MKL to do linear algebra stuff.  Plenty of linear algebra libs already 
  have this support so the only tricky part is ripping matrix/vector maths out 
  of weka and injecting ours.  May not be possible, but would be awesome to 
  get scikit-learn style performance for classifications.
